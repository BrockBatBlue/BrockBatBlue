## Hi there 👋

I am in many ways a hobbyist: active and restless by nature. I have lived many lives as a horse trainer, writer, nursing assistant, college student with B.S. in Biology while majoring in Literature, literature teacher, gardening enthusiast, video game enthusiast, full-stack web developer, front-end web developer teacher, and traveler. Each has its own chapter both sequestered and fluid.

- 😄 Pronouns: they/them
- ⭐ Languages and technologies: JavaScript, HTML, SQL, SCSS, Tailwind, Flexbox, React, React Three Fiber, Threejs
